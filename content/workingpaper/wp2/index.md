abstract: This paper investigates the turnover tax reform of China which replaced turnover tax with value added tax in service sector and terminated the “dual-track” taxation regime. By analyzing admin istrative tax dataset for over 37,000 firms, we document a significant productivity-enhancement effect on manufacturing sector. On average, firms with one more percentage point of manufacturing revenue share experienced 0.65% more increase in productivity. However, the effect was less pronounced for financially constrained firms, probably due to their weakness in market power which resulted in an absence of demand increase from pilot sectors. Our empirical results highlight the “dark” side of the dual-track taxation system and have meaningful implications for tax policies beyond China.
