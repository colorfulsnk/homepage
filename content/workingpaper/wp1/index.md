abstract: We investigate the underlying motivations that drive local governments to manipulate GDP figures in the Chinese context of National Poor County (NPC) designation and cancellation. Using a county-year panel that combines satellite nightlight data with self-reported GDP statistics, we document that, compared to counties that were never designated, being selected as an NPC in 2011, which involves substantial fiscal transfers, is associated with a greater degree of GDP underreporting in the year of designation, suggesting a response to fiscal incentives. This underreporting effect is more pronounced for counties with worse fiscal conditions. We also find that national poor counties would overreport GDP figures to a greater degree since 2016, after the central government set poverty eradication by 2020 as a non-negotiable task, suggesting a response to political incentives. This overreporting effect appears to be persistent, exists only in provinces that lack statistical self-discipline, and can be mitigated by central statistical supervision, thus addressing the principal-agent problem. Our results are unlikely to be driven by differences in tenure years or individual characteristics of county political leaders.
