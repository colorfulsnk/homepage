abstract: This paper investigates the political incentives behind the local officials’ behavior of data manipulation using ongoing place-based policies in China. Specifically,we employ satellite nightlight data and GDP statistics to generate a proxy for data manipulation at the county level, and examine how China’s poverty alleviation program and cancellation of the national poor county program affects the local data manipulation under a difference-in-differences framework. The results show that local governments tend to take action of underreporting GDP data to qualify for the programs when putting on the “hat of poverty” in 2011, and take action of overreporting GDP data to complete the political tasks when removing the “hat of poverty” after 2018. The further evidence implies that China’s additional special institutional arrangements, such as statistical inspection and supervision of poverty alleviation,have abated the data manipulation of local governments to some extent, which fully reflects the spiral progress of the institution of Chinese style. We use the dynamic place-based policy shocks to identify the effect of political incentives on local governments’ behavior and provide new evidence to a better understanding of local governments’ behaviors and Chinese special Institutional arrangements.
